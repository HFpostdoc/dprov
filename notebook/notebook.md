# Research and Software Development Projects for the Data Provenance Toolbox

Matthew K. Lau, PhD.

*Harvard Forest*


Proposed Projects
- Data Provenance for Genomics Pipelines
- Native viewing of DDG within R 
- Graph Theory Based Identification of Code Crux Points

- Reviews of other data provenance methods:

# 2 May 2016

Prepping for meeting with PIs

- Questions about grant goals
 - Need the final proposal
- Paper target
 - MEE? R Journal? Journal of Statistical Software?
- Dataverse Workshop?
- ESA 2016 Latebreaking?
- RMA meeting = possible group of users
- Add me to RDataTracker repo
 - Re-structure to make installable from github
 - ESS
 - Rmarkdown and Sweave

The end result will include a library for use by any software
developer to collect and use provenance, a demonstration of that
library in both the R and Little-JIL. The different teams serve as
platforms and testbeds for one another: The MHC team is a testbed and
critical audience for the Harvard libraries, while the Harvard Forest
team is a *testbed and critical audience* for the R and Little-JIL
tools. The final test is the value that *added provenance
capabilities* bring to the scientific results produced by the Harvard
Forest team.

Goals:

- "Bringing the users to the tools"
- Reconciling provenance at multiple semantic granularities
- Capturing detailed provenance at the level of a programming language
- Defining precisely aspects of provenance required for different use
cases
- Making provenance accessible to scientists
- API Design
- RDataTracker library
- Scientific applications using provenance
- Intellectual Merit = bridging the gap between provenance capture and
use
- Broader Impact = environmental science, omics, physics and data
  mining applications. Presentation at ecology meetings. 

- Research Plan
 1. Layering in PASS
 2. A Graphical Model of Provenance
 3. Library Architecture
 4. Provenance Reconciliation
 5. Provenance in support of Use Cases
 6. Responding to provenance queries
 7. API Design

- Engineering Management and Sustainability Plan
 1. Sustainability Plan = maintaining software for the long term

- Project Plan
 1. Core Provenance Library

- Education and Outreach

- Results from Prior NSF Support
 1. PQL: A Path Query Language
 2. Support for Atomic Sequences of File System Operations
 3. Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research
  - Historical legacies of landuse
  - Climatic change
  - Ecosystem trajectories
  - Strong biogeochemical resiliency
  - Effective ecological interpretation
  - Engage early with decision-makers
