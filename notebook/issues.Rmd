RDataTracker Issues
===================

98] Add test for all possible data types 

- ?

97] Very long node name 

96] RMarkdown 

- Rmarkdown and Sweave would be good to integrate
- Literate computing has people wrap their code into these files
- Could also be a good way to integrate across software languages

95] Include standard output in provenance 

92] Overwrite option 

91] github-install 

- Requires re-structuring of repo
- Development documents should be moved out
- New folder structure should be R man vignette DESCRIPTION NAMESPACE, etc.

90] Include more attributes 

89] Default ddg directory name

88] Default directory

87] Use relative

85] Add more file-reading functions 

82] Leave tryCatch node out of the ddg 

79] Investigate parallelism 

- This is a real challenge because of the dependence on .Rhistory
- Requires investigating the variety of parallel computing tools and
  batch systems

78] ddg.run error in emacs using ESS 

- This issue arises largely from how ESS handles .Rhistory

77] Creating file in nodes 

76] ddg call as last line of a function results in mismatched Start...Finish nodes 

75] Unsure how to use ddg.graphic.out 

72] Automatic annotation of lapply, sapply, and vapply

71] Automatic annotation of tryCatch functions 

70] Restoring files from checkpoints 

64] Chain together revised versions of a data

63] Record elapsed cpu time 

59] R parser does not find functions correctly 

56] Performance Report Inaccuracies 

55] Font issues with Java 8 

54] Adding start/finish nodes with ddg.function/return.value 

52] S3 Objects and Reference classes 

51] Returns nodes link to wrong function node within recursive functions 

46] Using ddg.procedure to annotate steps within a function

44] parent.frame and getting the environment 

36] Possible writes of variables enhancement

35] Ant test script when run from eclipse question

33] Ant test script on Windows Computers bug

30] Dealing with RData Nodes enhancement help wanted

21] Save ddg.txt enhancement help wanted

7] Monitor RStudio releases for fix to Windows timestamp problem. bug

- Where is this at?

1] Add flag to DDG enhancement
