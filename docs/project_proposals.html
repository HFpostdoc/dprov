<h1>Research and Software Development Projects for the Data Provenance Toolbox</h1>

<h2>Data Provenance for Genomics Pipelines</h2>

<ul>
<li>Genomics pipelines process large amounts of often noisy data using
multiple software packages, which could be aided by data provenance
methods to make their processes, resulting datasets and associated
errors transparent. Of particular need, is a means to track and view
data processes and analyses from the multiple languages comprising
these diverse, "Rube Goldberg"-esque, pipelines spread across more
than one programming language.</li>
<li>The RDataTracker software package is designed to document data
handling performed by R scripts, has a simple implementation
framework and graphical output, which, because it is written in R,
an open source programming language with native capabilities for
communicating with other programming languages (including python,
c++, java and bash), is naturally poised to incorporate data
provenance from other languages and other provenance tracking
systems.</li>
<li>In this project, we will extend the capabilities of the RDataTracker
package to incorporate provenance information from other parts of
data pipelines not written in the r language, and will begin by
exploring the following possible goals:
<ol>
<li>Incorporate data provenance information from the prov package
written in python</li>
<li>Integrate this new information stream into the existing DDG
graphical output </li>
<li>Test these methods with a real genomics data pipeline</li>
</ol></li>
<li>An integrated framework will provide a large community of coders
creating data pipelines with a sophisticated tool for tracking their
data for the purpose of data documentation and code improvement. In
addition, this project will pave the way for expanding data
provenance capabilities toward the goal of tracking multiple
streams of information from different sources across different
software languages.</li>
<li>Possible products from this project include:
<ol>
<li>Presentations at ecological, genetics and CS conferences</li>
<li>A Methods in Ecology and Evolution (MEE) paper</li>
<li>Applications papers</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Possible challenges:
<ol>
<li>Genomics pipelines work on large datasets which often require
working on servers and parallelization, which could both present a
challenge for using the RDataTracker software, which relies on the
.Rhistory files generated by R scripts. Expanding the possible
recording and tracking methods might address this and would also
make RDataTracker more robust.</li>
<li>Some packages used by these pipelines may be proprietary or use
proprietary data formats. This could possibly be addressed by
collaborating with these software companies to make their data
formats open-source.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2>Native viewing of DDG within R</h2>

<ul>
<li>The RDataTracker generated DDGs can be viewed with the Java based
DDG Viewer; however, some users may not have access to either the most
current version of Java or Java at all. </li>
<li>Adding DDG based on network visualization methods in R provide an
alternative, Java independent, means to visualize DDG that could be
scripted, automated and written natively in R.</li>
<li>To accomplish this, we can explore extant packages within R that
provide network plot functions and interactive graphing
capabilities, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="Rgraphviz">http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rgraphviz.html</a></li>
<li><a href="networkD3">http://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/</a></li>
<li><a href="plotly">https://plot.ly/r/</a></li>
<li><a href="Leaflet">http://leafletjs.com</a></li>
<li><a href="rCharts">http://rcharts.io</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Graph Theory Based Identification of Code Crux Points</h2>

<ul>
<li>R scripts tend to produce DDG that tend to be graphs with high
directionality and little feedback; and they are often large enough
to make it difficult to identify important nodes in the code</li>
<li>Graph and network theoretic analysis are often applied to complex
systems of inter-elated components (e.g. food webs, the Internet,
transportation systems)</li>
<li>Adding such analyses to the RDataTracker package and DDG Explorer
would provide additional means for users to explore their scripts in
a more efficient and informative way</li>
<li>Several possible avenues to explore would be:
<ol>
<li>Weighted graph statistics to measure node importance </li>
<li>Module and cluster identification algorithms to identify groups of nodes</li>
<li>Flow analysis statistics from Ecosystem Network Analysis theory to
measure node and pathway importance</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The <a href="enaR">https://github.com/SEELab/enaR</a> provides many of these
tools and could be integrated into or adapted to work with
RDataTracker DDG</li>
</ul>
