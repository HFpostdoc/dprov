###Data Provenance Grant

###Comments from MKL

## - Consider defining the need for data tracking first
## - What is the audience? Semantic granularities is difficult language
## - What does the trace look like?
## - What is the memory space required for a typical provenance?
## - Compare provenance to version control systems
## - Does source code encourage annotation?
## - Connect the background to the Cases through the context of data intensive methods
## - Most ecologists are currently not trained in appropriate software best practices and proveneance would help.
## - The ecological example is good. Ecology is becoming more data driven and needs similar tools to improve the field.
## - Long Term: share data and analyses?
## - Research Plan: add text on utilizing open-source development tools?
## - Research Plan: develop through education, open-access
## - R provides multiple toolboxes that could be useful for analyzing provenance data, e.g., igraph, sna, network, etc.
## - The network approach is good, but jargon intensive, focusing on graphics and perhaps a graphical apporach for analyzing provenance data would be beneficial
## - Putting the query model before the network description might be helpful

#Main Questions
- What is the computational/data overhead?
- Is there a way to show what a user might see?
- Will computer scientists be reviewing this? If so, include an
example of how computer science uses versioning and software tracking
tools, but many scientists generally don't. E.g., biologists are
generally not even trained in software best practices (see attached paper)
- An additional long-term goal might be to share data for synthesis
and meta-analyses
- If open-source development is desirable, a line or two on Git/Github
driven software development could be added
- The graph theoretic approach is good, but jargon
intensive. Depending on the possible reviewers, I suggest minimizing
by moving the definitions into the figure and/or figure legend. 
- On first pass it seems as though the query model should come before
the graph theoretic description.
