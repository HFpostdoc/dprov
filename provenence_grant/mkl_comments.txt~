## - Consider defining the need for data tracking first
## - What is the audience? Semantic granularities is difficult language
## - What does the trace look like?
## - What is the memory space required for a typical provenance?
## - Compare provenance to version control systems
## - Does source code encourage annotation?
## - Connect the background to the Cases through the context of data intensive methods
## - Most ecologists are currently not trained in appropriate software best practices and proveneance would help.
## - The ecological example is good. Ecology is becoming more data driven and needs similar tools to improve the field.
## - Long Term: share data and analyses?
## - Research Plan: add text on utilizing open-source development tools?
## - Research Plan: develop through education, open-access
## - R provides multiple toolboxes that could be useful for analyzing provenance data, e.g., igraph, sna, network, etc.
## - The network approach is good, but jargon intensive, focusing on graphics and perhaps a graphical apporach for analyzing provenance data would be beneficial
## - Putting the query model before the network description might be helpful
